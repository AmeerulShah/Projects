4)Main Idea of Project:
Building efficient work streams across the product/project management cycle have become crucial to tackling a complex project and 
delivering accountable deadlines. Especially with the involvement of additional factors which significantly increase the complexity
of the project, such as the stakeholders involved in a project being dispersed across different locations wherein they may each be 
working in different timezones while also adopting various types of work modes, such as hybrid or work-from-home, thanks to the hybrid-first 
work culture that is quickly emerging since the beginning of COVID-19. Ensuring sufficient coordination and association between the 
various project stakeholders becomes paramount in this situation. Thus, arises a vital need for a methodology that would be able to 
tackle such scenarios and make the entire product development process more streamlined and efficient. We collected numerous surveys, 
questionnaires, and interviews to analyze the situation further. We also collected online datasets to investigate the pre-covid scenario. 
After a thorough analysis and analytical comparisons, we showed how the scrumban(A convenient mixture of Scrum+Kanban) was the
most optimal solution for the post-covid-19 era. 

5)Status of research paper: Currently undergoing review and pending publishing. Should be published in the early months of January.
